### calculating GDP
1. **The product or value added approach**: The amount of output produced by **our economy**, excluding output used up in intermediate stages of production. Equivalently, it is the value added by each producer.
	NOTE: exlcude captial goods like buildings,houses,factories produced from intermediate goods used.
	GDP = output produced (including unsold) - intermediate goods used (not capital, no deprociation included in gdp)

2. **The income approach**: The total income includes wage, taxes (government income) and after-tax profit. If we add the three sources of income and the variation of the inventory, we obtain $70,000.
    -   **Wage**: add wages earned by employee in the economy.
    -   **Governement Revenue**: The total government income(taxes) - subsidies.
    -   **After-tax profit**: The total after-tax profit in the economy. (add depriciation for GDP)
    -   **Variation of inventory**: goods not sold - goods sold from inventory.
    
3. **The expenditure approach**: The total expenditure on final goods and investment products (at market price).
    
    The total value of expenditure is C+G+I+X−M = GDP
    
    - **Consumption (C)**: The total expenditure in final goods by private individuals (not used as intermediate goods to produce other goods)).
      C = sum of goods sold to public in our economy (exculding capital)
    - **Government Expenditure (G)**: The total government expenditure on final goods. subsidies not considered.
      G = sum of goods sold to govt in our economy (not including capital)
    - **Investment (I)**: The total values of capital goods purchased by the private and public sectors (equipment, buildings and inventory). 
      I = sum of capital sold to public and companies + **Variation of inventory**
      Note : subtract depriciation from I for NDP
    - **Export (X)**: Total value of goods produced in the economy and purchased by individuals living in another economy. 
    - **Import (M)**: Total value of goods produced outside the economy and purchased by individuals living in our economy. including goods imported and used in production.


- GDP + NFP = GNP

### Definitions
- NDP = net domestic product
- NFP = net factor payments from abroad
- TR = transfers recieved from government
- INT = interest payments on government's debt
- T = taxes
- NX = net exports
- G = Government expenditure (from the expenditure approach)
- C = consumption expentiture (from the expenditure approach)
- I = Investment expenditure (from the expenditure approach)

### Formulas
- GDP = Depreciation + NDP
  
- **private Disposable income** : **PDI** = GDP + NFP + TR + INT - T
  
- **Net Government Income** : **NGI** = T - TR - INT

- **Current Account Balance** : **CA** = NX + NFP

- **Private Saving** : $S_{pvt}$ = PDI - C

- **Government Saving** : $S_{govt}$ = NGI - G (negative of government budget deficit)

- **National Saving** : 
	- **S** = $S_{pvt}$ + $S_{govt}$   
	- **S** = (GDP + NFP - T + TR + INT - C) + (T - TR - INT - G) = GDP + NFP - C - G
	- **S** = (C + I + G + NX) + NFP -  C - G  =  I + (NX + NFP)
	- **S** = I + CA (A.K.Anational wealth)


### Paasche Quantity Index
-  A Paasche quantity index (PQ) fixes the prices to the current period$$PQ_{t/0} = \dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}P_{it}Q_{it}}{\sum_{i=1}^{N}P_{it}Q_{i0}} \times 100$$
### Laspeyres Quantity Index
- The Laspeyres quantity (LQ) index uses the prices of the base period. $$LQ_{t/0}= \dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}P_{i0}Q_{it}}{\sum_{i=1}^{N}P_{i0}Q_{i0}} \times 100$$
### Fisher Quantity Index
- The Fisher quantity index (FQ) is defined as the geometric average of the Paasche and the Laspeyres indexes.$$FQ_{t/0}=100 \times \sqrt{PQ_{t/0} \times LQ_{t/0}}$$
### Chained Quantity Index
- chained paasche : $CPQ_{t/0}=PQ_{1/0} \times PQ_{2/1} \times PQ_{3/2} \times ... \times PQ_{t/t-1} \times 100$
- chained laspeyres : $CLQ_{t/0}=LQ_{1/0} \times LQ_{2/1} \times LQ_{3/2} \times LQ_{t/t-1} \times 100$
- chained fisher : $CFQ_{t/0}=100 \times \sqrt{CPQ_{t/0} \times CLQ_{t/0}}$



### Paasche Price Index
- ${ PP_{t/0} = \dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^N P_{it}Q_{it}}{\sum_{i=1}^N P_{i0}Q_{it}}\times 100 }$
  
- chained : ${CPP_{t/0} = PP_{1/0}\times PP_{2/1}\times PP_{3/2}\times\cdots\times PP_{t-1/t-2}\times PP_{t/t-1}\times100 }$


### Laspeyres Price Index
- ${ LP_{t/0} = \dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^N P_{it}Q_{i0}}{\sum_{i=1}^N P_{i0}Q_{i0}}\times 100 }$
  
- chained : ${ CLP_{t/0} = LP_{1/0}\times LP_{2/1}\times LP_{3/2}\times\cdots\times LP_{t-1/t-2}\times LP_{t/t-1}\times100 }$

### Fisher Price Index
- ${ FP_{t/0} = 100 \times \sqrt{PP_{t/0}\times LP_{t/0}} }$
  
- chained : ${ CFP_{t/0} = 100 \times \sqrt{CPP_{t/0}\times CLP_{t/0}} }$


### The Deflation Approach
- $$ \text{Real value} = \dfrac{\text{Nominal value}}{\text{Price index (NOT IN PEERCENTAGE , DIVIDE BY 100)}} \ $$
- $\text{GDP deflator}=\dfrac{\text{Nominal GDP}}{\text{Real GDP}}\times 100$


### The Consumer Price Index
- The consumer price index (CPI) is a Laspeyres type of price index in the sense that it compares the cost of a past fixed basket of goods between the base and current periods.
- The main difference between the CPI and a Laspeyres price index is that the price reference period is not the same as the basket reference period. However, it is sufficient for this course to assume that it is a Laspeyres price index

### The Inflation Rate
- Inflation rate is defined as the growth rate of the general price level
-  $$\pi_{2012} = \dfrac{CPI_{2012}-CPI_{2011}}{CPI_{2011}}\times 100$$


### Nominal and Real Interest Rate
- $$ r = \dfrac{1+i}{1+\pi}-1 \approx i - \pi \ $$
- r = real interest rate
- $\pi$ = inflation rate
- i = nominal interest rate
