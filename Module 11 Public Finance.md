## Government Expenditure
- involvement of a government in an economy is represented to some extent by the amount of government spending over a period
- This is an imperfect measure because it hides interventions that are not directly reflected in expenditure (e.g. financial market regulations, workplace safety regulations, seat belt law, etc.)
- governments tend to spend more in periods of crisis to support the economy (e.g. unemployment benefits).
- expenditure in percentage of GDP$$\dfrac{\dfrac{\text{Expenditure}}{\text{Price}\times\text{Population}}}{ \dfrac{\text{GDP}}{\text{Price}\times\text{Population}}}\equiv \dfrac{\text{Expenditure}}{\text{GDP}}$$
-  the needs of the provinces have increased and the ability of the provincial governments to generate revenues also.
- The three most important components of government spending are consumption of goods and services, transfers to households and the interest on debt.
- Expenditure on goods and services includes consumption that serves the society as a whole (defence, justice, etc.) and consumption that serves individuals (health care, education etc.)
- The second most important component with 25.06% of total expenditure is the transfers to households. This component includes child benefits, employment insurance benefits, social assistance, old age security, etc. The third most important component with 6.79% of total expenditure is the interest on debt.
  
## Government Revenue
- The five main sources of revenues are taxes on income (40.8%), taxes on production and imports (29.7%) which include sales taxes, contributions to social insurance plans like employment insurance (11.7%), sales of goods and services (9.7%) and investment income (6.1%) which includes interest on loans and royalties.
  
## Government Deficit
- A **deficit** is defined as total expenditure minus total revenue over a given period of time.
- a **surplus** is defined as the negative of the deficit: revenue minus expenditure.
- The deficit and surplus are flow variables because they represent the difference between two other flow variables: expenditure and revenue per period.
- When the deficit is positive, a government must borrow money by issuing bonds.
- ### Real Per Capita Deficit in Canada
	- As for any variables measured in dollars, it is preferable to remove the effect of inflation.Also, it is better to look at the surplus per individual hence we use real per capita surplus.
- ### Deficit as a Percentage of GDP in Canada
	- We can also analyze the surplus or deficit as a percentage of GDP. It is a better measure because it takes into account the size of the economy.

## Government Debt
-  Successive deficits result in an accumulation of government bonds in circulation that the government will eventually need to repurchase. This stock of bonds in circulation is the government debt.
- **Gross debt**: This is the sum of all government bonds in circulation. It is an important measure because interest payments on debt are based on it: the higher the gross debt, the higher the interest payments.
- **Net debt**: This is the gross debt minus the value of the financial assets owned by the government: loans made by the government, taxes receivable, foreign exchange accounts, etc. It is considered a better measure of the financial difficulties that the government faces because it is what the gross debt would be if the government used all its financial assets to pay back part of the debt.
- **Accumulated deficits**: This is the net debt minus the value of the non-financial assets. It is often how federal debt is defined in the media. It can also be obtained by adding all past deficits and subtracting all past surpluses.
  
- #### Nominal Debt
	- misleading because it is expressed in current dollars.
- #### Real Debt
	- takes inflation into account
	- it does not take into account the population growth.
- #### Real Per Capita Debt
	-  takes into account the population growth.
	- imperfect measure because it ignores the size of the economy: a large debt is not as large when the capacity to repay, measured by the GDP, is larger
- #### Debt as a Percentage of GDP
	- it takes into account the change in price, population and national income.
	- ratio has no measurement units so we can easily use that measure to compare the level of indebtedness of countries.
	  
- ### Interest Payment
	- An indebted government is required to use a fraction of its revenue to pay interest on its debt.This could be costly for the population because it implies that the government has less money to provide them with services.
	- There are two factors that affect the amount of interest payments: 
		- **for a given interest rate**, the interest payments increase when the gross debt increases
		- **for a given gross debt**, the interest payments increase if the interest rate increases.
			- affected by the credit rating of the government. A bad rating means that a government is likely to not pay back its debt, making it riskier for investors to purchase its bonds. In that case, investors ask for higher returns to compensate for the risk hence a large debt may lead to an increase in the interest rate paid by the government on its debt.
- ### Who Holds the Canadian Government Debt
	- Higher interest payments may be more problematic if the government debt is held by foreign investors because in that case a large fraction of the government revenue leaves the country.
	- Notice that having a high proportion of debt held by residents does not imply that the cost of being indebted is low. One consequence could be to increase inequality if the debt is held by richer individuals, especially if it limits the government to spend on social programs.
